NOT a complete product or test. Spoke to Lee about some issues with Nested sets and Laravel7 possible issues. I tore down the code base and tried to rollback to Laravel6, but that presented a couple of other issues (Vue routes acting weird and route->model bindings). So, the code is in a weird state.

Work in progress.
